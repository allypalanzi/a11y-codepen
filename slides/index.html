						It’s important to not think of disability as something that only effects a subset of users. It’s not something you can tell from your analytics, you can’t see who’s using a screen reader on your webpage, and there’s not a great way to test for if folks are only using keyboards to interact with your site.

						When we first wrote all of these docs, we had talked about open sourcing them however it was out of scope for the two day hackathon. Because of our successes with sharing it within the company, we really wanted to figure out how to share it with the world.

						Because of how she was using these docs, we thought that a checklist builder might be useful for everyone.
						<br><br>
						So after two days — we launched acccessibility.voxmedia.com
						<br><br>
						We have the site divided into the same sections we created documentation for — designers, engineers, projects managers, qa, and editorial, and it allows you to select the items relevant to your projects and outputs a list for you to copy out at the end. It also includes tons of links to resources and tools.
